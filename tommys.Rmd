This is a map created by Leaflet for the Coursera "Developing Data Products" course. It shows the location of Original Tommy's Burgers in Los Angeles, CA, a fine place to order a chili burger. It's often imitated but there's nothing quite like the original Tommy's. If it don't got the shack, take it back!


```{r map2}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- my_map %>%
        addMarkers(lat=34.069802, lng=-118.276577,
                   popup="Original Tommy's Hamburgers")
my_map
```
